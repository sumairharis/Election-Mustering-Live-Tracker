# Polling Party Location Tracking System

This Node.js server application provides real-time location tracking for polling parties. Polling parties use the index.html interface to select their destination polling station, and their locations are automatically sent every minute. The internal team can view the dashboard.html for tracking purposes.

## Features

- Polling parties select their destination once; thereafter, tracking is automatic.
- Real-time updating of the dashboard with polling party locations.
- Uses Leaflet map for visualization.
- MongoDB database for storing location data.
